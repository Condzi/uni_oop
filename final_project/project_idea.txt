Project idea:

  The database tables would contain columns like:
  - Students and instructors basic personal data
  - Grades from a courses and final grades
  - types of attending courses by the students
  - course information
  - (and more, I didn't think about that too much. Of course, the 
     tables will be normalised)

  The data would be saved in some kind of CSV format, but with every table in one .txt file.

  The software itself will contain at least three possible privillages modes:
  - read only  (student -- can only check his own grades)
  - read/write (instructor -- can see only his own courses and students marks from that course)
  - read/write (administrator -- can remove students from courses, sending messages...)

  I'm not predicting any advanced security measures (like passwords for the accounts), 
  since I think that it's not in the scope of this project.
